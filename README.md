spritekitjoints
===============

A collection of simple demoes of each SKJoint type available in SpriteKit with the ability the interact with them dynamically.

This repository is based on code samples used in my /dev/world/2014 talk and is intended a baseline for people wanting to experiment with SKJoints but not necessarily know how.

The inclusion of a drag and drop provides a crude but handy way to actually see how joints work without requiring knowledge of things like applying force programmatically through code.

Ideally I'd recommend first making slight changes to varaibles and seeing the effect and than gradually experiment by constructing more complex joint arrangements.
